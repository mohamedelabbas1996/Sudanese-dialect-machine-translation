# Sudanese-dialect-machine-translation

## Abstract
Addressing the prevalent challenge of language resource disparity, this re
search primarily aims to enhance the accessibility of English content for
speakers of the Sudanese dialect, a recognized low-resource language. Our
strategic approach involved fine-tuning an established English-Arabic multi-
lingual machine translation model, thereby leveraging the existing linguistic
similarities between the Sudanese dialect and Modern Standard Arabic. To
achieve this, a distinct dataset was developed, comprised of 911 Flores-101
sentences translated into the Sudanese dialect. This dataset was instru-
mental in fine-tuning the model and in subsequent performance evaluation.
The study was predicated on the M2M100 model, a highly proficient base
model selected for its potential to significantly improve in handling the Su-
danese dialect. A comparative analysis was conducted between the enhanced
M2M100 model’s output and that of advanced language models, namely
Chat GPT, to evaluate performance with respect to low-resource languages.
In an additional bid to assess the model’s robustness and versatility, its
effectiveness was evaluated across resource-rich language pairs, specifically
English-Arabic, in bi-directional translation tasks.
